# Production override for PhotoSafe Docker Compose
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
#
# Or with environment file:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.production up -d
#
# This override file removes development volume mounts and uses the code
# baked into the Docker images instead.
